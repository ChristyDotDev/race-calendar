### Race Calendar

I want a nice way to see what racing events are coming up this week. Ultimately I want to make this a slash command in a discord or an automated email at the start of the week but at first I just want to parse some ical files from the internet and give an endpoint to return the data

### Source Data

Starting off I'll use the cal files linked here: https://toomuchracing.com/calendar/
